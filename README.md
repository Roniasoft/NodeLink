# NodeLink

Introduction
============
NodeLink is a qml node editor library that can be used for a wide range of applications. This library allows for the visualization and manipulation of complex graphs while also providing the flexibility for customization and integration with other software. 

Usage
=============

The Nodelink library is a tool that can be used to connect different components within a system or application. To use this library, one can refer to the examples provided within the library and follow the instructions accordingly. The examples provided serve as a guide and demonstrate how to connect different nodes and manipulate data between them.

Platforms
---------

* Linux (x64, gcc-7.0, clang-7)
* OSX (Apple Clang - LLVM 3.6)
* Windows (Win32, x64, msvc2017, MinGW 5.3)

Dependencies
------------

### C++ / Build
- **C++ standard:** C++17 (project is tested with C++17-compatible toolchains).  
- **CMake:** ≥ 3.8 (recommended: 3.20+).  
- **Compilers (examples):**
  - Linux: GCC ≥ 7.0 or Clang ≥ 7.0
  - Windows: MSVC 2019 (Visual Studio 2019) or MinGW (if supported)
  - macOS: Apple Clang 
- **Optional / recommended tools:**
  - `nproc` or similar for parallel `make -j`
  - Git ≥ 2.20 (to handle submodules comfortably)

### Qt / QML
- **Qt:** ≥ 6.4.0 (project tested with Qt 6.4+).  
- Required Qt modules (used by NodeLink QML components):
  - `QtQuick`
  - `QtQuick.Controls`
  - `QtQml`
  - `QtQuick.Layouts`


Current State (v0.9.0)
==================

The main features are as follows:

- MVC design
- Background/Foreground drawings
- Custom Node UI
- Custom Node Data
- Custom Link/Connection
- Link/Connection Type (Bezzier, Straight Line, L Shape, etc)
- Scene Overview
- Dynamic Links/Ports
- Dynamic Scene
- Undo/Redo
- Zooming
- Save/Load
- Snapping

Help Needed
==================
- Zoom performance

Any suggestions are welcome!

Building
========

### 0. Quick notes
- The repo uses Git **submodules** for some dependencies. You must clone/update submodules to get a working tree.  
- You can build from command-line (CMake + make / ninja) or with **Qt Creator**.

### 1. Clone repository (including submodules)
Recommended (single step):
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Roniasoft/NodeLink.git
cd NodeLink
```
If you already cloned without --recursive:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```  

If you want to update submodules to their remote branches later:
```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```  

(Linux / macOS — command-line example)
-----
```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  make -j$(nproc)
  sudo make install
```  
Notes:
To change install location use **-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/path**.  


Build with Qt Creator
----------

1. Open `CMakeLists.txt` as project.
2. `Build -> Run CMake`
3. `Build -> Build All`
4. Click the button `Run`

Troubleshooting
----------
Missing Qt modules: make sure your Qt installation includes QtQuick, QtQuick.Controls, and other listed modules.  
Submodule folders empty: run git submodule update --init --recursive.  
CMake errors: delete build/ and re-run CMake to get a clean configure.  

Contribution
============

#. Be polite, respectful and collaborative.
#. For submitting a bug:

   #. Describe your environment (Qt version, compiler, OS etc)
   #. Describe steps to reproduce the issue

#. For submitting a pull request:

   #. Create a proposal task first. We can come up with a better design together.
   #. Create a pull-request. If applicable, create a simple example for your
      problem, describe the changes in details, provide use cases.

#. For submitting a development request:

   #. Describe your issue in details
   #. Provide some use cases.
